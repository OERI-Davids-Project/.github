# David's Project

David's Project is an innovative initiative by Old Dominion University (ODU) and the [Office of Enterprise Research and Innovation(OERI)](https://oduinnovate.org) aimed at developing the first telehealth robot specifically designed for children. This project was inspired by David Carey, a young patient at the [Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters (CHKD)](https://www.chkd.org), who envisioned a robot to help pediatric patients communicate and interact without leaving their hospital rooms.

## Project Overview

The telehealth robot, named in memory of David Carey, enables hospitalized children in isolation to virtually engage with other patients and participate in activities. Dr. Tina Gustin, co-director of ODU’s [Center for Telehealth Innovation, Education and Research (C-TIER)](https://telehealtheducation-ctier.com/davids-project-designing-the-first-telehealth-robot-just-for-children/), collaborated with OERI researchers, including [Yiannis Papelis](https://www.odu.edu/directory/yiannis-papelis), to bring this vision to life. The team also partnered with students from the Governor’s School for the Arts to design a child-friendly robot prototype.
